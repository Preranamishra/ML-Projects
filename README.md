This project predicts additional taxi fare charges for NYC yellow cabs using machine learning. By analyzing February 2016 trip data, I developed a binary classification model that achieved 80% accuracy. Future improvements will focus on hyperparameter tuning and feature analysis to enhance model performance and fare estimation.
